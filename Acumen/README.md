Building a Django Chat Application with Gemini API Integration
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a Python Django application that acts as a chat interface, allowing users to enter queries which are then sent to the Gemini API to retrieve responses. The application should maintain separate conversations for multiple users without intermingling the chats and display the last three queries and responses for better context.

Project Requirements
1. Set Up Environment
Install Django and Necessary Libraries
Install Django: Use pip to install Django and any other required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
pip install django
Set up a Django Project:

Create a new Django project.
bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject chat_project
Create a new application within the project.
bash
Copy code
cd chat_project
python manage.py startapp chat_app
2. Design User Interface
Create Chat Interface
Design HTML Template:

Create an HTML template that resembles WhatsApp's chat interface, allowing users to enter queries and view responses.
Include input fields for user queries and display areas for responses.
Styling with CSS:

Style the chat interface using CSS to make it look appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript for Interactivity:

Use JavaScript to handle the dynamic aspects of the chat interface, such as sending queries and displaying responses.
Display Previous Conversations
Query and Response Display:
Implement logic to display the last three queries and responses along with the new ones.
3. Integrate with Gemini API
Set Up Gemini API Integration
API Credentials:

Obtain API credentials from the Gemini API.
Authentication:

Set up authentication for accessing the Gemini API.
HTTP Client:

Use Django's built-in HTTP client or third-party libraries like requests to send queries to the Gemini API.
Send Queries and Display Responses
Functionality Implementation:
Implement functionality to send user queries to the Gemini API and retrieve responses.
Display the responses in the chat interface.
4. Manage Multiple Chat Sessions
Session Management
Separate Chat Sessions:
Implement logic to manage separate chat sessions for multiple users.
Ensure that each user's chat history is maintained separately without intermingling.
5. Testing
Test Chat Interface
Simulate User Interactions:

Test the chat interface by simulating user interactions.
Ensure queries are sent to the Gemini API and responses are displayed correctly.
Verify Session Management:

Verify that the application maintains separate chat sessions for multiple users.
Project Deliverables
Django Application
Django project and application code containing the chat interface and Gemini API integration logic.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript Files
Files for the chat interface design.
Documentation
Detailed documentation on setting up, running, and testing the Django application.
Explanation of the Gemini API integration and chat session management logic.
Tips
Use Django Channels:

Consider using Django Channels to enable WebSocket communication for real-time chat updates.
Focus on UX:

Pay attention to the user experience and design an intuitive chat interface.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling for API requests and other potential issues.
Security:

Ensure that sensitive data, such as API credentials, is handled securely.
Scalability:

Design the application to handle multiple users and scale as needed.
Summary
By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to develop a real-time chat application using Django and integrate it with external APIs like the Gemini API. This project showcases skills in web development, API integration, and user interface design.
