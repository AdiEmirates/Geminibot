**ChatBot Application Documentation**

---

### 1. Set Up Django Environment

#### Install Django:
```bash
pip install django
```

#### Set Up a New Django Project:
```bash
django-admin startproject chatbot_project
```

#### Create a New Application:
```bash
cd chatbot_project
python manage.py startapp chatbot_app
```

### 2. Design User Interface

#### Create Chat Interface:
- **HTML:** Design the chat interface using HTML to structure the layout.
- **CSS:** Style the interface using CSS to resemble WhatsApp.
- **JavaScript:** Implement interactive features and smooth user experience using JavaScript.

#### Display Previous Conversations:
- Implement logic in JavaScript to display the last three queries and responses along with new ones.
- Ensure smooth scrolling and intuitive user experience in the chat interface.

### 3. Integrate with Gemini API

#### Set Up Gemini API Integration:
- Obtain API credentials from Gemini and set up authentication for accessing the API.
- Use Django's built-in HTTP client or third-party libraries like `requests` to send queries to the Gemini API.

#### Send Queries and Display Responses:
- Implement functionality to send user queries to the Gemini API from the chat interface.
- Retrieve responses from the Gemini API and display them in the chat interface.

### 4. Manage Multiple Chat Sessions

#### Session Management:
- Implement logic in Django to manage separate chat sessions for multiple users.
- Ensure that each user's chat history is maintained separately without getting intermingled with others.

### 5. Testing

#### Test Chat Interface:
- Simulate user interactions to test the chat interface.
- Verify that queries are sent to the Gemini API and responses are displayed correctly.
- Test multiple user scenarios to ensure that chat sessions are managed correctly.

### Additional Notes:

- **Deployment:** Deploy the ChatBot application on a server using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- **Security:** Implement secure communication protocols and user authentication to protect user data and privacy.
- **Scalability:** Design the application architecture to handle a large number of concurrent users efficiently.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and detect any issues in real-time.
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation for the project including setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
